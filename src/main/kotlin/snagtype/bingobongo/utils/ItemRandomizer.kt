//todo: given a list of items, randomly select given count (24/25 depending on free space)
// random selection should ignore NBT
//weight each mod proportional to the number of items in each mod. (subject to change)
// note that mods with just a few items in them will have a higher chance of selection with this method.
// (later) ignore blacklisted mods
// (optionally) select a random NBT after creating the list.
